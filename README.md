# Background
New York Citi Bike Program is esponsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In this project, Tableau was used to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. The period of this project was Bike Trips in NYC between June 2020-September 2020.

The data file contains 4 csv files that were use to create the visualizations. The vizualizay=tions answered a series of questions among which :

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
