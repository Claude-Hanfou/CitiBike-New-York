# Background
New York Citi Bike Program is esponsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In this project, Tableau was used to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. The period for this project was Bike Trips in NYC between June 2020-September 2020.

The data file contains 4 csv files that were use to create the visualizations. The visualizations answered a series of questions among which :

* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

#### These visualizations that can viewed at the webpage and Tableau public link provided below.

##  Citi Bike Analysis

#### Top Stations  Dashboard
On this dashboard we can observe that the top start and end stations for the entire period are relatively spread across the map from each other.  This could be because during summer months, bikers take advantage of the warm weather to access different stations.
The slider shows that the month of June has stations spread away from each other as compared to the month of July, August and September

#### User Based Dashboard
This dashboard has a combination of visualizations based on the bike users. We can observe certain phenomenon’s . The User type has more subscribers as compared to customers and there is a high usage during morning rush hours for the subscribers. This couldbe linked to most subscribers are commuting to their workplace using bikes. 

As for gender, there are more male bike users as compared to female bike users. Males bikers are above 400 thousands and females users are slightly above 200 thousand users which shows a huge disparity between both. This was an interesting phenomenon to notice. Also, males tend to ride more around 6pm to 7pm, while women seem to peek around 5pm. 

The ride bikes growth also had an interesting phenomenon. Around June 7 the rides were at 83.6% and drastically went down to 32.1% by July 12. This could be attributed to a rise in the covid virus during those periods or bikers commuting to work starting to work from home and therefore reducing the number of rides during those periods. By August 9th, 2020, the rides percentages went down to 7.9% and by September 27, the rides went to the negative to -48.4%. Again, these drastic changes can be attributed to the pandemic and less people commuting to work, parcs or other places.

The average trip duration by age was also an interesting phenomenon to observe. There is a spike in usage in people born in 1970, these individuals are around 50 years old and may use bikes to commute to work or for leisure purposes. People born in 2002 and 2004 also have a high average trip duration, these individuals are teenagers and might privilege an accessible means to commute around the city.

#### Time and Station Dashboard
The total trips per station provides a rank of all the end stations name with their name, number of appearance and rank number. It can be observed that 12 Ave & W 40 St station is the most popular station for the entire period followed by West St & Chamber St, and the bottom stations are Sip Ave and Walton Ave & E 171 St. Equally it can be observed that stations 12 Ave & W 40 St and West St & Chamber St, are consistently in among the top 10 for the month of June, July, August and September. This may be due to the fact that these locations are situated at strategic locations and make it easy to access for bikers to start and end their trip

In addition during summer, bike usage consistently increases 5-9am this could account for individuals commuting to work and in the 5pm – 6pm are very popular hours for bikers.
