# Background
New York Citi Bike Program is esponsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In this project, Tableau was used to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. The period of this project was Bike Trips in NYC between June 2020-September 2020.

The data file contains 4 csv files that were use to create the visualizations. The vizualizay=tions answered a series of questions among which :

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

##  Citi Bike Analysis

#### Top Stations  Dashboard
On this dashboard we can observe that the top start and end stations for the entire period are relatively spread across the map from each other.  This could be because during summer months, bikers take advantage of the warm weather to access different stations.
The slider shows that the month of June has stations spread away from each other as compared to the month of July, August and September

#### User Based Dashboard
This dashboard has a combination of visualizations based on the bike users. We can observe certain phenomenonâ€™s . The User type has more subscribers as compared to customers and there is a high usage during morning rush hours for the subscribers. This couldbe linked to most subscribers are commuting to their workplace using bikes. 

As for gender, there are more male bike users as compared to female bike users. This was an interesting phenomenon to notice. Also,males tend to ride more around 6pm to 7pm, while women seems to start their rides around 4pm. 

The ride bikes growth also had an interesting phenomenon. Around June 7 the rides were at 83.6% and drastically went down to 32.1% by July 12. This could be attributed to a rise in the covid virus during those periods or bikers commuting to work starting to work from home and therefore reducing the number of rides during those periods. By August 9th, 2020, the rides percentages went down to 7.9% and by September 27, the rides went to the negative to -48.4%. Again, these drastic changes can be attributed to the pandemic and less people commuting to work, parcs or other places.

The average trip duration by age was also an interesting phenomenon to observe. There is a spike in usage in people born in 1970, these individuals are around 50 years old and may use bikes to commute to work or for leisure purposes. People born in 2002 and 2004 also have a high average trip duration, these individuals are teenagers and might privilege an accessible means to commute around the city.
